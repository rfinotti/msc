## IMPORTANT!!!

# If you plan to enable RCON in your server, please follow the bellow steps before you start the server for the first time:

1- Open the "server.properties":
    Go to line 8 to set your server's difficulty.
    Go to line 12 and enable RCON.
    Go to line 42 and set a strong password.

2- Open the Dockerfile and set the "Xmx" according to your server's RAM capacity.
    If your server has a maximum of 16GB of RAM and there are no other services running, I suggest you to set the Xmx at 14G as it is right now.

Now you can simply run the comand bellow to start the server.

'''
docker-compose up
'''

Do not forget to open the Ports 25565 for minecraft server and 25575 for rcon
